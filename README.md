# Data-Driven Insights on Life Expectancy: Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictive Modelling
This repository contains the code and report for the project "Data-Driven Insights on Life Expectancy: Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictive Modelling". 
The dataset can be accessed from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who. It contains information on various factors that may affect the life expectancy of individuals in 193 countries from 2000-2015. The features are divided into several categories, including immunization-related factors, mortality factors, economical factors, and social factors.

## Problem Statement
The analysis aims to answer the following questions:
- Are there any anomalies in the dataset that need to be addressed?
- Are there significant differences in life expectancy across countries or regions?
- Are there any trends or patterns in life expectancy over time?
- What are the factors influencing life expectancy?
- Can a predictive model (Random Forest) be developed to accurately predict life expectancy?

## Objectives
The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Life Expectancy dataset, generating meaningful insights and visualizations. Additionally, a predictive model using Random Forest will be developed to accurately predict life expectancy.
